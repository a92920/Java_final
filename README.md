For the final, I have chosen to do 3 bar charts and 1 3D chart using JTablesaw. 

I have used bar charts mostly as they are the simplest way to show how data would look like a line chart (by looking at the difference
between the heights of the data points), as well as to show critical information such as the colored differences shown in 
blue and red for differentiating a category with only two values such as Survived or Sex and their counts and categorize them 
in groups. The 3D chart is also shown to visualize a wider variety of comparisons between categories.

Graph 1 displays a bar chart with Class Survival where the x-axis is the class the y-axis the count of people in that class,
and red is denoted by "0", and blue by "1" as the Survived category. 
In this graph, you can clearly state that the class who has a higher chance of survival is class 1 and the class with least 
chance of survival is 3


Graph 2 displays a bar chart with Gender Survival where the x-axis is the Survived category the y-axis the count of people in 
"0" or "1" of the Survived category,
red is denoted by Male and blue by Female of the Sex category. 
In Grap 2 you can denote that the Female sex has survived much more than their male counterparts.

Graph 3 displays a bar chart with Age Survival where the x-axis is the Age the y-axis the count of people of that age,
and red is denoted by "0", and blue by "1" as the Survived category. 
Graph 3 shows that the age group that was least able to survive the crash is the age group of 17 till 32. This graph is also 
interesting as it starts to show resemblance with a normal distribution curve, this is likely due to the mean of age being
in the 21 to 23 age range since the graph is right-tailed (skewed to the right) and the highest value is 48 people for people 
not survived at the age range of 20-22 

Graph 4 is a 3D graph that shows that displays Fare, Parents/Children abroad Age Survival as X, Y, Z, and colored dots,
in their respective orders. It can be noticed in this graph that the people in the center of all data points Survived more than the people further away.
